# Extending Quarto

Quarto is designed to be extensible. This chapter introduces how to install, use, and create extensions such as themes, filters, and shortcodes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7.1 What is a Quarto Extension?

An extension is a reusable bundle that can include:

-   🧩 Themes (CSS, SCSS)
-   🛠️ Lua filters
-   🔧 Shortcodes
-   📚 Project templates

They can be published to GitHub and installed via `quarto add`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7.2 Installing Extensions

To install an extension:

``` markdown
quarto add quarto-ext/fontawesome
```

This will download the extension and add it to your project’s `_extensions/` folder.

Other examples:

``` markdown
quarto add quarto-ext/clean
quarto add quarto-ext/authoring
```

List installed extensions:

``` markdown
quarto list
```

## 7.3 Using Extensions

Example: using the Font Awesome icon extension:

::: {.fa-solid .fa-book}
This is a book icon
:::

Themes:

``` markdonw
format:
  html:
    theme: [cosmo, clean]
```

## 7.4 Creating Your Own Extension

You can create a new extension skeleton with:

``` bash
quarto create extension my-ext --type=filter
```

Quarto supports extension types:

-   `format` (custom format template)

-   `filter` (Lua filter logic)

-   `shortcode` (templating)

-   `theme` (CSS)

## 7.5 Building a Quarto Template

If you'd like to turn Evanbook into a reusable template:

``` bash
quarto use template evanbio/evanbook
```

Or share a structure via GitHub with a `template.qmd`, `_quarto.yml`, and `README.md`.
