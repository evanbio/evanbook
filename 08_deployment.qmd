# Deployment and Publishing

Once your Quarto book is complete, you can publish it as a website for others to read and reuse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8.1 Rendering the Site

Build your book locally with:

``` bash
quarto render
```

The output will be saved in the `output-dir`, typically `_book/`.

Preview locally:

``` bash
quarto preview
```

## 8.2 Publishing to GitHub Pages

### ✅ Step 1: Push your book to GitHub

Make sure your `_book/` folder is **not ignored** if you're pushing directly.

``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "deploy: render book"
git push origin main
```

### ✅ Step 2: Deploy via `gh-pages` branch

You can use the official GitHub Actions:

``` markdown
quarto publish gh-pages
```

> Automatically creates and deploys to the `gh-pages` branch.

## 8.3 Publishing via Netlify

### ✅ Step 1: Link GitHub repo in Netlify

### ✅ Step 2: Set build command

``` bash
quarto render
```

✅ Step 3: Set publish directory:

``` markdown
_book

Push to GitHub → Netlify auto-builds → auto-publishes.
```

## 8.4 Publishing via Vercel (Optional)

-   Upload static `_book/` to `/public`

-   Or use Vercel CLI

Note: Vercel is better for dynamic content (like APIs); Netlify is preferred for books.
